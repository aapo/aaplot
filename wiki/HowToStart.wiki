= How to start =
If you have bazaar installed on your system, you can get latest sources:

bzr branch http://lauta.dyndns.org/aaplot

In Ubuntu you need libglu1-mesa-dev package (for gl.h)

sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev

If you want take screenshots, you need libpng. In Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install libpng3

If you do NOT install/have libpng, you must make two changes:

    * In aaplot.h comment the line #define AAPLOT_SCREENSHOT
    * In Makefile remove -lpng from LDFLAGS= 

aaplot has very cool icon and you need libXpm. In Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install libxpm-dev

If you do NOT install/have libxpm-dev, you must make two changes:

    * In aaplot.h comment the line #define AAPLOT_ICON
    * In Makefile remove -lXpm from LDFLAGS= 


Now you can build all examples.
