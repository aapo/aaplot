#windows version
= Introduction =

aaplot can be used with windows too. At least with XP. 

Sources are same than linux, just use Makefile_win.
 make -f Makefile_win all

= What is missing or wrong or not tested =
  * there are warnings about unused variables (there are callback-functions etc.)
  * glut_cursors aren't same than in linux (odd)
  * input_boxis do not work (BUG)
  * icon disabled (Xpm not tested)
  * screenshot disabled (libpng not tested)
  * gsl not tested

If you know how to fix any of these, drop me a mail.

= What is needed for windows? =
Just for example:

Dev-C++ 5.0 beta 9.2 (4.9.9.2) (9.0 MB) with Mingw/GCC 3.4.2

from http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html
(59M installed size)
 (I tested with this, and it works)
