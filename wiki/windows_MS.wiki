#windows version
= Introduction =

aaplot can be used with windows too. At least with XP. 

Sources are same than linux, just use Makefile_win.

= What is missing or wrong or not tested =
  * there are warnings about unused variables (there are callback-functions etc.)
  * glut_cursors aren't same than in linux (odd)
  * input_boxis do not work (BUG)
  * First when window pops, moving behaves wrong: You must change to rotatemode and take 'center view' (BUG, maybe win and lin initialize variables differently)
  * icon disabled (Xpm not tested)
  * screenshot disabled (libpng not tested)
  * gsl not tested

If you know how to fix some of these, drop me a mail.
