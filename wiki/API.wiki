#How to use aaplot

= Basic =
Write c-file, include aaplot
{{{
#include "aaplot.c"
}}}
Compile 
{{{
gcc -lpng -lGL -lGLU
}}}

-lpng means libpng, which is used to screenshooting. (aaplot can be compiled without it)

-lGL and -lGLU are mandatory

= API for version 0.2=
in aaplot_defaults.c are limits of the _drawing cube_.
{{{
double lower_x_limit = -10.0;
double upper_x_limit = 10.0;

double lower_y_limit = -5.0;
double upper_y_limit = 5.0;

double lower_z_limit = -3.0;
double upper_z_limit = 3.0;
}}}
You can change the values in your code.
== addRFunction ==
void addRFunction(int win,double (`*`func_ptr)(double),double size, double step, char `*`title)   

win
 Windows number. First window is 0.

func_ptr
 Pointer to function, which is like
  double some_function(double x) {return x+1;}

size
 Size of plots.

step
 Stepping of x. Let say first value of x is A, then second value is A+step. And all values are A+(step `*` n), where n is integer.

title
 Title of functions. Will be written in 'legend' in same color than function itself. (legend is info box, which lists all functions)


=== Example ===
{{{
#include "aaplot.c"
double f(double x) {
return x*x;
}

int main()
{
addRFunction(0,&f,3.0,0.01,"x * x");
drawAll(); 
return 0;
}

}}}
