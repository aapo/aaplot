INFO
====
aaplot is function plotting library/toolkit.

USAGE
=====
Make c-file, include aaplot.h, compile, run.

1)
c-file like this:
#include "aaplot.h"

double f(double x) {
return 3*x*x + 4*x -5;
}

int main(){
 addRFunction(0,&f,0.01,"My Function");
  /* 0   = window number
    &f   = pointer to your function
    0.01 = stepping of x 
   "My Function" = just some title
  */
 drawAll();
 return 0;
}

2)
compile like this:
gcc -lXpm -lpng -lGL my_file.c aaplot.a

3)
run like this:
./a.out



GUI
===
With mouse

Right mouse button

    Opens the Menu. Menu entries can be clicked with left or right button. 

Menu

    * Toggle Move/Rotate -mode
    * Change cursor to crosshair
    * Prints manual (to console at this moment)
    * Reset view back to normal
    * Hiding/Unhiding coordinateplanes (XY,YZ,XZ)
    * Close all gl-windows.
    * With every function/table
          o Change title
          o Change point size
          o Change stepping (both if have two steppings)
          o direction (e.g. f(z)=x)
          o New color (pick next random color)
          o Hide/Unhide 

Left mouse button + moving mouse

    * If you are movingmode it will pan (eg. move) the whole view.
    * If you are rotatingmode it rotates the view.

          moving left <-> right

              Y-axis stay in place and zx-plane rotates 

          moving up <-> down

              X-axis stay in place and zy-plane rotates 

Middle mouse button

    Marks one point to coordinate. (This works correct only if view is not rotated) 

Mouse wheel

    Zooming in and out.

With Keyboard

1 and 2	       X-axis stay in place and zy-plane rotates
3 and 4         Y-axis stay in place and zx-plane rotates
5 and 6         Z-axis stay in place and xy-plane rotates
z               Take screenshot
UP/DOWN 	Scales y-axis
LEFT/RIGHT 	Scales x-axis
Shitt + UP/DOWN 	Scales z-axis
a/d : increase x-boundaries
w/s : increase y-boundaries
q/e : increase z-boundaries
A/D : decrease x-boundaries
W/S : decrease y-boundaries
Q/E : decrease z-boundaries
ESC 	Close all windows





HACKING
=======
Filenames beginning with aaplot* are one layer, wroted just for this project.
Filanames beginning with aaglut* are adopted from openglut-project. (with some modifications)

So I suggest you start with aaplot-files. It is like gl with glut programming. If something 
do not work, it might be because of my aaglut-modifications.
